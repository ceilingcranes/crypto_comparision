# crypto_comparision
A half-completed program to analyze cryptocurrency data.
Data was pulled from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory), although it isn't currently up to date in this repository. 
Code can plot comparisons, take in file names and only plot those values, and will perform anaysis to provide a root mean square line in order to compare recent trends, although this line has the units of seconds, while the data is in days. 

Now that school is started, I likely won't work on this much, so I thought I would put it out there.
